Using this [feature](https://appsignal.com/accounts/status_pages), you can expose uptime monitoring metrics on a public status page.

## Setup

To setup, a new public status page, click the "Add status page" menu and select your organization.

Fill out the public page title, description, subdomain and select the existing uptime monitors whose metrics you want to display on the public page.

Once the status page is created, you can view its summary and edit it in the future using the "Edit status page" button.

-> The subdomain under which your status page will be available can take up to 10 minutes before it is available.

Once the subdomain is available, you can start viewing the metrics on it.

Hovering over any bar will display a tooltip with extra information.

If you want to view the details of all bars at the same time rather than hovering over them individually, you can click on a title.

A sidebar will appear that will contain a list of all outages.

### Status page updates
Once the status page is up and running you can start posting updates by clicking on the "Add update" button.

While posting a status update, you can select four different types of global status:

* Investigating
* Identified
* Recovering
* Resolved

Selecting `investigating`, `identified`, or `recovering` will report the page as down, whereas selecting `resolved` will report the page as up.

After adding the status, you will be able to view that on the internal status page.

As well as on the public status page.

Once the issue has been resolved, post another update with a `resolved` status to let your customers know that everything is working fine.
