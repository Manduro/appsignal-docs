title: "Host metrics"
---

The AppSignal agent collects various system metrics, which allows you to correlate performance issues and errors to abnormal host metrics. This data is available in the [Host metrics](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/app?to=host_metrics) section in the app overview, which allows you to inspect and [compare multiple hosts](https://blog.appsignal.com/2018/02/20/comparing-hosts.html). We also show a host metrics overview on the sample detail page for error and performance incidents.

For a preview of how host metrics look in the AppSignal interface, please see our [host metrics](https://www.appsignal.com/tour/hosts) tour page.

## Collected host metrics

The following host metrics are collected by the AppSignal agent for every minute on your system.

    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>CPU usage</td>

      <td>1 minute load average on the host.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Memory usage</td>
      <td>Available, free and used memory. Also includes swap total and swap used.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Disk usage</td>
      <td>Percentage of every disk used.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Disk IO</td>
      <td>Throughput of data read from and written to every disk.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Network traffic</td>
      <td>Throughput of data received and transmitted through every network interface.</td>

These host metrics are collected by default. To disable it, use the `enable_host_metrics` configuration option, for [Ruby](/ruby/configuration/options.html#option-enable_host_metrics) and [Elixir](/elixir/configuration/options.html#option-enable_host_metrics).

### Environment metadata

The AppSignal agent reports the following information of the host. Once received this metadata is shown on the [host metrics index page](https://appsignal.com/redirect-to/app?to=host_metrics) per host to provide more detail of all hosts running an app. Use this metadata to spot any differences between hosts that could cause differences in behavior.

- Host architecture, 32 or 64-bit.
- Operating System, either Linux, macOS or Windows.
- Operating System Distribution, for Linux this reports Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.
- Operating System version, the version of the Operating System.
- Kernel version, for Linux this reports the installed kernel version.

This metadata is collected by default. To disable it, use the `send_environment_metadata` configuration option, for [Ruby](/ruby/configuration/options.html#option-send_environment_metadata).

## Heroku support

To use host metrics on Heroku, head to the [Heroku host metrics][heroku support] page.

##=container-support Docker/container support

To use host metrics on (Docker) containers, head to the [container host metrics](/metrics/host-metrics/containers.html) page.

## Dokku support

-> **Note**: Dokku support is available in packages Ruby gem 3.0.13, Elixir package 2.2.0, Node.js package 2.0.0 and newer.

[Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku) has host metrics enabled by default as long as your Dokku application has the `DOKKU_ROOT` environment variable set up.
