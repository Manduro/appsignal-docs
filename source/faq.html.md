## Getting started

### I need help getting started. Where do I begin?

If you're new to AppSignal or want to know more about to configure AppSignal features, please [read our guides](/guides/) to get set up.

## AppSignal libraries

### What programming languages does AppSignal support?

AppSignal supports the [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) programming languages and/or runtime. We also have [JavaScript packages](/front-end) available for the browser to catch client-side errors.

### Filtering data

#### How to ignore actions from your app?

By [ignoring actions](/guides/filter-data/ignore-actions.html) it's possible to not record any data for the configured actions, requests, background jobs, etc.

#### How to ignore errors in your app?

By [ignoring errors](/guides/filter-data/ignore-errors.html) AppSignal will ignore errors matching the exact name of an error.

#### How to filter data that's being send to AppSignal?

- [Filter request parameters and background job arguments](/guides/filter-data/filter-parameters.html).
- [Filter session data for HTTP requests](/guides/filter-data/filter-session-data.html).
- [Filter HTTP request headers](/guides/filter-data/filter-headers.html).

### How to add additional instrumentation to my app?

Add additional instrumentation to your app to gain more insights in how your application is performing by measuring the duration of separate events. Read how in the documentation for our [Ruby gem](/ruby/instrumentation/instrumentation.html) and [Elixir package](/elixir/instrumentation/instrumentation.html).

### How to run multiple applications on one host?

By default AppSignal is configured to assume one application runs on one host. If you run more than one application on a host, some odd behavior may occur, such as data being reported for a different app.

To configure AppSignal for multiple applications on one host the AppSignal working directory needs to be configured. Read more about how to configure the working directory in our [guide to running multiple application on one host](/guides/application/multiple-applications-on-one-host.html).

### What Operating Systems does AppSignal support?

Please see our [Operating Systems](/support/operating-systems.html) page for the full list of support Operating Systems and what packages it requires.

### How to debug an issue with the AppSignal integration?

Please see our [debugging guide](/support/debugging.html) for a complete guide to debug issues with the AppSignal integration.

Also check our [known issues](/support/known-issues.html) page for issues that may be present in your version of the AppSignal integration.

## User account

### How to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for the AppSignal app?

Please see our [two-factor authentication](/user-account/two-factor-authentication.html) page for more information.

## IP addresses used

At the moment the AppSignal push API can use one of the following ip addresses:

```
37.252.121.227
37.252.120.243
185.191.3.93
185.191.3.94
185.191.3.125
185.191.3.126
```

We don't recommend whitelisting specific ip's, because in the future they might change or more might be added, in case we need to scale in an emergency or cycle our loadbalancers. If you do decide to whitelist these IP adress please send [support](mailto:support@appsignal.com) and email, we'll make sure to notify you if there are upcoming changes.
